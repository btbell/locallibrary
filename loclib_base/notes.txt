<!-- TODO -->
    - add books by author on author details page
        - at this point, i'm leaving the author detail page as is (listing all books, but also showing
        the correct author id. nowhere can i find decent examples of trying to get the backward
        relationship working. all examples are either looking for author name OR the examples show a
        fixed value. I want to pull my hair out at this point but i dn't have any. moving on to next chapter.
